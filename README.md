Project Description 

A project for Computer Graphics course. It is a casual obstacle game, where players dodge incoming objects as they move along. It is a very simple game made with Babylon. The name of the game is Snowfall Hurdle, which simple means obstacles in the snow. The name itself is already self-explanatory, so people can easily identify what it is about.

Gameplay

The players start the game by pressing the space button. Once the space button is pressed, the character will start moving forward. The forward movement is automatic, so the player only needs to move left and right. There are three lanes for the players to switch from one to another. Each lane will be presented with random obstacles. And different obstacles have different heights. Players need to avoid the obstacles by making the character jump, which is activated by the space button. Players can make the character jump twice in the air by pressing the space button twice. Double jumps are needed to avoid obstacles with greater heights. Players can also change lane while the character is jumping. Players will die if they collide with any obstacles. The game will then halt, and only starts again when the space button is pressed.
